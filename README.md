## Part 1: [Advancing Spanish SER: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Pre-Trained Models](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/8/4340)

This repository is part of a broader research initiative in affective computing, focused on advancing **SER** technologies in the Spanish language. Our research, as presented in the MDPI article [‚ÄúMultitask Learning for Spanish Speech Emotion Recognition‚Äù (MDPI, 2024)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/8/4340), explores the development of robust and generalizable models, with this main contributions:

 * First comprehensive benchmarking of PTMs for Spanish SER, covering six diverse databases
 * Robust evaluation combining LOSO with layer-wise feature extraction
 * **Superpassing the Spanish SER's State-of-the-Art**

Our main results are sumarized in these tables and images:

## Part 2: Multitask Learning

This work introduces the first MTL approach for Spanish SER, trained on six diverse corpora. Using a frozen Wav2Vec2 XLSR encoder and an MLP classifier, the proposed system surpasses the single-task baseline by 2.37 WF1 points, reaching **90.56%** in emotion classification, while also achieving near-perfect scores in speaker profiling (**99.39%**) and regional accent detection (**99.91%**). 

Notably, this performance was obtained **without any data augmentation or resampling**, demonstrating the intrinsic benefits of **multitask regularization**. The system adheres to **rigorous and reproducible evaluation protocols**, including **weighted F1, Recall and Precision metrics** and **cross-corpus validation** ‚Äî addressing key methodological gaps in prior Spanish SER studies.
